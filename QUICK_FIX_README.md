# 🎯 QUICK FIX - Test Now!

## ⚡ What Was Wrong
Register 8 wants **PERCENTAGE (0-100%)**, not watts!

## ✅ What Was Fixed
- ESP32 now converts watts → percentage automatically
- Added direct percentage command
- Updated test scripts

## 🚀 Test Now (3 Steps)

### **Step 1: Flash Updated Firmware**
```bash
cd /Users/prabathwijethilaka/Sem7/Embedded/EcoWatt_TeamPowerPort/PIO/ECOWATT
pio run --target upload
pio device monitor
```

### **Step 2: Queue Percentage Command**
```bash
cd /Users/prabathwijethilaka/Sem7/Embedded/EcoWatt_TeamPowerPort/flask

# Test with 50%
python queue_command_for_esp32.py set_power_percentage 50
```

### **Step 3: Watch ESP32 Serial**
You should see:
```
Received command: set_power_percentage
Setting power percentage to 50%
Sending write frame: 110600080032...  ← 0x32 = 50 decimal
Received frame: 110600080032...       ← SUCCESS! (echo response)
Power percentage set successfully to 50% ✅
```

## 📊 Verify Success
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5001/command/statistics" | jq
# Should show: "completed": 1, "success_rate": > 0%
```

## 🎉 Expected Result
- ✅ No more Exception 03 errors
- ✅ Echo response from inverter
- ✅ Command status = "completed"
- ✅ Success rate > 0%

**Test percentages to try:**
- 0% (turn off)
- 25% (low power)
- 50% (half power)
- 75% (high power)
- 100% (max power)

**Files changed:**
1. `PIO/ECOWATT/src/main.cpp` - Fixed conversion
2. `flask/queue_command_for_esp32.py` - Added percentage command
3. `flask/test_percentage_commands.sh` - Test script
