# 🚀 FINAL SPRINT - Action Plan

## Current Status: **95% Complete!** 🎉

You just achieved a MAJOR milestone - FOTA working end-to-end (1.0.3 → 1.0.5)!

---

## 🎯 **3 Tasks Remaining** (2-3 hours total)

### ⚡ Task 1: Build Firmware 1.0.6 with Security (10 minutes)

**Why?** Current firmware (1.0.5) doesn't have security manager

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Update version in platformio.ini or main.cpp
cd /Users/prabathwijethilaka/Sem7/Embedded/EcoWatt_TeamPowerPort/PIO/ECOWATT

# 2. Build firmware
pio run

# 3. Copy firmware to flask folder
cp .pio/build/esp32dev/firmware.bin ../../flask/firmware/firmware_1.0.6.bin

# 4. Prepare for OTA
cd ../../flask
python prepare_firmware.py  # Will ask for version 1.0.6
```

**Expected Result:**
- New firmware with security headers
- Flask server has 1.0.6 available for OTA

---

### ⚡ Task 2: Test FOTA Failure Scenarios (30 minutes)

**Why?** Need to verify rollback and error handling

#### Test A: Wrong Hash (5 min)
```python
# In prepare_firmware.py or manually edit manifest
# Change hash to wrong value
# ESP32 should reject and NOT apply update
```

**Expected:** Download succeeds, verification fails, rollback to 1.0.5

#### Test B: Wrong Signature (5 min)
```python
# Modify signature in manifest
# ESP32 should detect invalid signature
```

**Expected:** RSA verification fails, firmware rejected

#### Test C: Network Interruption (10 min)
```bash
# During OTA download:
# 1. Start update
# 2. Disconnect WiFi mid-download
# 3. Reconnect
# 4. ESP32 should resume or retry
```

**Expected:** Resume from last chunk OR start fresh download

#### Test D: Rollback Mechanism (10 min)
```bash
# Flash intentionally broken firmware
# ESP32 should detect boot failure
# Auto-rollback to previous working version
```

**Expected:** Automatic rollback to last good firmware

**Document Results:**
- Create FOTA_TEST_RESULTS.md
- Record all test outcomes
- Include serial logs for each scenario

---

### ⚡ Task 3: Demo Video (60-90 minutes)

**Why?** Required for project submission

**Duration:** 10 minutes maximum

#### Setup (10 min):
```bash
# Terminal 1: Flask server
cd flask
python flask_server_hivemq.py

# Terminal 2: ESP32 monitor
cd ../PIO/ECOWATT
pio device monitor

# Terminal 3: Commands
cd ../../flask
# Ready for curl commands and test scripts
```

#### Recording Sections (60 min):

**Section 1: Introduction (1-2 min)**
- Show project structure
- Open PHASE4_README.md
- Explain what was implemented

**Section 2: Remote Configuration (1-2 min)**
- Show current config on ESP32
- Update via MQTT or Flask API
- Show ESP32 applying changes (no reboot!)
```bash
# Example: Change upload frequency
curl -X POST http://10.78.228.2:5001/device_settings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device_id":"ESP32_EcoWatt_Smart","upload_freq":30}'
```

**Section 3: Command Execution (2-3 min)**
- Queue commands via test script
```bash
python test_command_queue.py
```
- Show ESP32 retrieving commands
- Show commands executing
- Show results reported back
- Display command history

**Section 4: Security Features (2 min)**
- Run security tests
```bash
python test_security.py
```
- Show valid requests passing
- Show invalid requests rejected
- Show replay attack detection
- Display security stats

**Section 5: FOTA Update (2-3 min)**
- Show current version (1.0.5 or 1.0.6)
- Trigger OTA check
- Watch download progress
- See hash & signature verification
- Watch reboot
- Confirm new version running

**Section 6: Summary (1 min)**
- Recap all features demonstrated
- Show integrated system view
- Mention documentation completed

#### Recording Tips:
1. **Screen recording:** Use QuickTime or OBS
2. **Terminal arrangement:** Side-by-side or tabbed
3. **Font size:** Increase terminal font for visibility
4. **Speed:** Don't rush, explain as you go
5. **Mistakes:** OK to pause and edit
6. **Keep focused:** Stick to 10 minutes max

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **FOTA Testing:** Use small test firmwares to speed up downloads
2. **Demo Video:** Record in sections, edit together later
3. **If stuck:** Check SUCCESS_REPORT.md for what's working
4. **Time pressure:** Demo is most important, FOTA failure tests can be documented theoretically
