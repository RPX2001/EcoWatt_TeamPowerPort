## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies âœ“

```powershell
cd "d:\Work\Semester 7\Embedded Systems\EcoWatt_TeamPowerPort\flask"
python install_dependencies.py
```

**OR manually:**
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Verify installation:**
```powershell
python -c "import flask; import paho.mqtt.client; from Crypto.Cipher import AES; print('All packages installed!')"
```

### Step 2: Test Security Layer âœ“

```powershell
python test_security.py
```

**Expected output:**
- Creates test secured payload
- Shows payload structure
- Saves to `test_secured_payload.json`

### Step 3: Start Flask Server âœ“

```powershell
python flask_server_hivemq.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
Starting EcoWatt Flask Server...
Connecting to MQTT broker...
Connected to MQTT broker at broker.hivemq.com
OTA firmware manager initialized successfully
Server running on http://0.0.0.0:5001
```

### Step 4: Test with Secured Payload âœ“

**In another terminal:**
```powershell
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/process -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @test_secured_payload.json
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "device_id": "ESP32_EcoWatt_Smart",
  ...
}
```

**Check server logs:**
```
Detected secured payload - removing security layer...
Security verified: nonce=10001, encrypted=False
Security layer removed successfully!
```

### Step 5: Update ESP32 Configuration âœ“

**Update server IP in ESP32 code:**
```cpp
// In PIO/ECOWATT/src/main.cpp
const char* dataPostURL = "http://YOUR_IP:5001/process";
const char* fetchChangesURL = "http://YOUR_IP:5001/changes";
```

**Replace `YOUR_IP` with your actual server IP address.**

### Step 6: Upload ESP32 Firmware âœ“

```bash
# In PlatformIO
pio run -t upload -t monitor
```

**Or in VS Code:**
- Click "Upload" button
- Open Serial Monitor

### Step 7: Verify End-to-End Flow âœ“

**Monitor ESP32 serial output:**
```
Payload secured with nonce 10001, HMAC authentication
UPLOADING COMPRESSED DATA TO FLASK SERVER
Upload successful to Flask server!
```

**Monitor Flask server logs:**
```
Detected secured payload - removing security layer...
Security verified: nonce=10001, encrypted=False
Security layer removed successfully!
Published 1 entries to MQTT
```

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Run `test_security.py` successfully
- [ ] Verify test payload created
- [ ] Check HMAC calculation is correct
- [ ] Verify base64 encoding works

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Flask server starts without errors
- [ ] Server accepts secured payloads
- [ ] Server accepts unsecured payloads (backward compatibility)
- [ ] HMAC verification works correctly
- [ ] Nonce validation prevents replay attacks
- [ ] Error handling returns proper 401 codes

### Security Tests

- [ ] **Replay Attack Test**: Send same payload twice
  - First: Should succeed (200 OK)
  - Second: Should fail (401 Unauthorized - replay attack)

- [ ] **Tampered Data Test**: Modify payload, keep MAC
  - Should fail (401 Unauthorized - HMAC mismatch)

- [ ] **Invalid Nonce Test**: Send old nonce
  - Should fail (401 Unauthorized - replay attack)

- [ ] **Missing Fields Test**: Send incomplete security data
  - Should fail (401 Unauthorized - missing fields)

### End-to-End Tests

- [ ] ESP32 successfully compresses data
- [ ] ESP32 applies security layer
- [ ] ESP32 uploads to Flask
- [ ] Flask verifies security
- [ ] Flask decompresses data
- [ ] Flask processes registers
- [ ] Flask publishes to MQTT
- [ ] No data loss in pipeline

## Security Verification

### âœ“ Pre-Shared Keys Match

**ESP32 (security.cpp):**
```cpp
const uint8_t SecurityLayer::PSK_HMAC[32] = {
    0x2b, 0x7e, 0x15, 0x16, ...
};
```

**Flask (flask_server_hivemq.py):**
```python
PSK_HMAC = bytes([
    0x2b, 0x7e, 0x15, 0x16, ...
])
```

âœ“ Keys match exactly!

### âœ“ Nonce Management

- [x] ESP32 increments nonce on each upload
- [x] ESP32 persists nonce to NVS
- [x] Flask tracks last valid nonce
- [x] Flask rejects old nonces
- [x] Thread-safe nonce updates on Flask

### âœ“ HMAC Calculation

**Both sides calculate:**
```
Data = [nonce (4 bytes big-endian)] + [JSON payload]
HMAC = HMAC-SHA256(PSK_HMAC, Data)
```

âœ“ Algorithm matches!

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Import errors for Crypto modules

**Solution:**
```powershell
pip uninstall crypto pycrypto pycryptodome
pip install pycryptodome
```

### Problem: HMAC verification always fails

**Checklist:**
- [ ] PSK_HMAC matches exactly between ESP32 and Flask
- [ ] Nonce is big-endian (4 bytes)
- [ ] Payload is UTF-8 encoded
- [ ] No extra whitespace in JSON

### Problem: Replay attack detection too sensitive

**Solution:**
Reset nonce tracking:
```python
# In flask_server_hivemq.py
last_valid_nonce = 9999  # Set below current ESP32 nonce
```

### Problem: ESP32 can't connect to Flask

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Flask server is running
- [ ] Server IP is correct in ESP32 code
- [ ] Port 5001 is not blocked by firewall
- [ ] ESP32 and Flask are on same network

## Production Deployment Notes

### ðŸ”’ Security Hardening (TODO for Production)

- [ ] Enable real AES encryption (set `ENABLE_ENCRYPTION = true`)
- [ ] Use environment variables for PSKs (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Implement key rotation mechanism
- [ ] Add TLS/HTTPS for transport security
- [ ] Persist nonce to database (not in-memory)
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent DoS
- [ ] Implement logging to external service
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerting for security events

### ðŸš€ Performance Optimization

- [ ] Add Redis for nonce storage (multi-instance support)
- [ ] Implement caching for decompression patterns
- [ ] Add load balancer for horizontal scaling

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring

- [ ] Log all security events (successful/failed)
- [ ] Monitor nonce gaps (detect missing packets)
- [ ] Track HMAC failure rate
- [ ] Alert on replay attack attempts
