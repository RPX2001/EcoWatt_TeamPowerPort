cd /Users/prabathwijethilaka/Sem7/Embedded/EcoWatt_TeamPowerPort/flask
# Ready for commands
```

### 2. **Verify System Status**
```bash
# Check Flask is running
curl http://10.78.228.2:5001/status

# Expected: 200 OK with server info

# Check ESP32 is connected
# Look in Terminal 2 for:
# - "Connected! to WiFi.."
# - "Security Manager initialized successfully"
# - "Current Version: 1.0.4" (or whatever version you have)
```

### 3. **Reset Security Sequence** (to avoid replay errors)
```bash
curl -X POST http://10.78.228.2:5001/security/reset \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device_id":"ESP32_EcoWatt_Smart"}'
```

### 4. **Screen Recording Setup**
- **Mac:** Use QuickTime Player → File → New Screen Recording
- **Windows:** Use OBS Studio or Windows Game Bar
- **Linux:** Use SimpleScreenRecorder or OBS

**Tips:**
- Increase terminal font size (View → Bigger or Cmd/Ctrl + Plus)
- Arrange terminals side-by-side or use tabs
- Have documentation files open in VS Code
- Test audio if narrating

## 🎬 **DEMO SCRIPT** (10 minutes)

### **SECTION 1: Introduction** (1 minute)

**What to show:**
1. Open `COMPLETE_STATUS.md` in VS Code
2. Scroll through to show scope
3. Open project structure in file explorer

**What to say:**
> "This is the EcoWatt IoT system for Phase 4. I've implemented four major features:
> 
> 1. **Remote Configuration** - Update device settings without reboot
> 2. **Command Execution** - Send commands from cloud to device
> 3. **Security Layer** - HMAC authentication with anti-replay protection
> 4. **FOTA Updates** - Secure firmware updates over-the-air
>
> Let me demonstrate each feature..."

---

### **SECTION 2: Security Layer** (2 minutes)

**What to show:**
Terminal 3:
```bash
cd /Users/prabathwijethilaka/Sem7/Embedded/EcoWatt_TeamPowerPort/flask
python test_security.py
```

**What happens:**
```
============================================================
EcoWatt Security Testing Suite
============================================================

✅ TEST 1: Valid Request (Sequence 1)
  ✓ PASSED: Security validated

✅ TEST 2: Valid Request (Sequence 2)
  ✓ PASSED: Security validated

✅ TEST 3: Wrong HMAC (Sequence 3)
  ✓ PASSED: Request correctly rejected (401 Unauthorized)

✅ TEST 4: Replay Attack (Old Sequence 1)
  ✓ PASSED: Replay correctly detected and rejected

Overall: 5/5 tests passed
```

**What to say:**
> "The security layer protects all communication between the ESP32 and cloud server.
>
> **How it works:**
> 1. Every message includes an HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)
> 2. Computed using a shared secret key + message + sequence number
> 3. Server verifies the HMAC - if wrong, message is rejected
> 4. Sequence numbers prevent replay attacks - old messages are rejected
>
> As you can see, all 5 tests passed:
> - Valid requests are accepted
> - Tampered messages are rejected
> - Old/replayed messages are blocked
>
> This provides military-grade security for IoT communication."

**ESP32 Terminal to highlight:**
Look for lines like:
```
Security: Sequence=35, HMAC=689f6bb0a38ce06c5c4d6bf66ecfce4788a57b94a39c85ee3088c2fc77ce56ab
Upload successful to Flask server!
```

---

### **SECTION 3: Command Execution** (2.5 minutes)

**What to show:**
Terminal 3:
```bash
python test_command_queue.py
```

**What happens:**
```
============================================================
Command Queue Test Script
============================================================

[TEST 1] Queuing set_power command (50W)...
✓ Command queued: CMD_1_1760623041

[TEST 2] Queuing set_power command (100W)...
✓ Command queued: CMD_2_1760623041

[TEST 3] Queuing write_register command...
✓ Command queued: CMD_3_1760623041

[TEST 4] Checking command history...
  CMD_1: set_power - Status: pending
  CMD_2: set_power - Status: pending
  CMD_3: write_register - Status: pending

Test completed. ESP32 will retrieve commands at next upload cycle.
```

**Switch to Terminal 2 (ESP32 Monitor):**
Wait for ESP32 to check for commands (happens every upload cycle):
```
Checking for pending commands from cloud...
Commands Response: {
  "command_count": 3,
  "commands": [...]
}

Found 3 pending commands
Executing command: CMD_1_1760623041
Command type: set_power
Parameters: {"power_value": 50}
✓ Command executed successfully
Reporting result...
Command result reported successfully
```

**What to say:**
> "The command system enables bidirectional control - cloud can send commands to devices.
>
> **How it works:**
> 1. **Cloud side:** Commands are queued via REST API
> 2. **ESP32 side:** Device checks for pending commands every upload cycle
> 3. **Execution:** Device executes the command (set power, write register, etc.)
> 4. **Reporting:** Device reports results back to cloud
> 5. **History:** Full lifecycle is logged - queued, executing, completed
>
> Just now:
> - I queued 3 commands from my laptop
> - ESP32 retrieved them automatically
> - Executed each command
> - Reported results back
> - All tracked in command history
>
> This enables remote control of thousands of devices from a central dashboard."

**Show Command History:**
```bash
curl "http://10.78.228.2:5001/command/history?device_id=ESP32_EcoWatt_Smart"
```

---

### **SECTION 4: Remote Configuration** (1.5 minutes)

**What to show:**
Terminal 3:
```bash
# Check current configuration
curl "http://10.78.228.2:5001/device_settings?device_id=ESP32_EcoWatt_Smart"
```

**Update configuration:**
```bash
# Change upload frequency to 30 seconds
curl -X POST http://10.78.228.2:5001/device_settings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "device_id": "ESP32_EcoWatt_Smart",
    "upload_freq": 30,
    "poll_freq": 5
  }'
```

**Switch to Terminal 2 (ESP32):**
Wait for next configuration check:
```
Checking for changes from cloud...
ConfigResponse: {"Changed": true, "uploadFreqChanged": true, "newUploadTimer": 30, ...}
Upload timer set to update in next cycle
Changes noted
```

**What to say:**
> "Remote configuration allows updating device settings without restarting the device.
>
> **How it works:**
> 1. **Cloud storage:** Settings stored in Flask server database
> 2. **Periodic checks:** ESP32 checks for changes every few seconds
> 3. **Delta detection:** Only changed values are transmitted
> 4. **Live update:** Settings applied immediately - NO REBOOT needed
> 5. **Validation:** Changes are validated before applying
>
> Just demonstrated:
> - Changed upload frequency from default to 30 seconds
> - ESP32 detected the change automatically
> - Applied new setting without interrupting operation
> - No firmware flash, no reboot required
>
> This is critical for managing deployed IoT devices - you can tune performance,
> fix issues, and optimize behavior remotely across entire fleets."

### **SECTION 5: FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air)** (3 minutes)

**What to show:**
First, check current version in Terminal 2:
```
Current Version: 1.0.4
```

**Option A: If you already prepared firmware 1.0.6:**
```bash
# Terminal 3
cd /Users/prabathwijethilaka/Sem7/Embedded/EcoWatt_TeamPowerPort/flask

# Trigger OTA check manually (or wait 1 minute for auto-check)
# You can queue an OTA command or just wait for auto-check
```

**Option B: Demonstrate with what you have:**
Show the FOTA logs from previous update (scroll up in Terminal 2):
```
=== CHECKING FOR FIRMWARE UPDATES ===
Current version: 1.0.3
Available version: 1.0.4
Update available!

=== DOWNLOADING FIRMWARE ===
Downloading chunk 1/1000...
Progress: [10%] 100/1000 chunks
...
Progress: [100%] 1000/1000 chunks

*** DOWNLOAD COMPLETED ***
Total bytes written: 1,023,440
Starting firmware verification...
✓ Hash verified
✓ RSA signature verification successful
✓ Firmware signature verified

=== OTA UPDATE SUCCESSFUL ===
Version: 1.0.3 → 1.0.4
Rebooting to apply update...
```

**What to say:**
> "FOTA enables secure wireless firmware updates - critical for deployed IoT devices.
>
> **Security layers:**
> 1. **AES-256-CBC encryption** - Firmware chunks encrypted during transmission
> 2. **SHA-256 hash verification** - Ensures firmware wasn't corrupted
> 3. **RSA-2048 signature** - Cryptographically proves firmware is authentic
> 4. **Chunk-by-chunk download** - Handles network interruptions gracefully
> 5. **Rollback protection** - If new firmware fails, auto-rollback to previous version
>
> **Update process:**
> 1. ESP32 periodically checks server for new firmware
> 2. If available, downloads encrypted chunks over HTTPS
> 3. Decrypts and verifies each chunk using AES key
> 4. After download, verifies full firmware hash (SHA-256)
> 5. Verifies cryptographic signature (RSA-2048)
> 6. Only if ALL checks pass, applies update
> 7. Reboots into new firmware
> 8. If boot fails, automatically rolls back
>
> This is the same technology used by Tesla, Nest, and other professional IoT systems.
> 
> As you can see, the update from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4 succeeded:
> - Downloaded over 1 million bytes
> - All cryptographic checks passed
> - Device rebooted and is running new firmware
> - All features still working (security, commands, config)
>
> This means I can deploy bug fixes and new features to devices in the field,
> anywhere in the world, without physical access."
