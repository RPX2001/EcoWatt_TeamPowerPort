/**
 * @file Uploader.cpp
 * @brief Implementation of the Uploader class for uploading inverter samples to a cloud service.
 *
 * @details
 * Implements the Uploader class methods, providing a wrapper around a CloudStub (or real cloud interface)
 * to manage the process of sending batches of inverter measurements. Designed for testability and
 * dependency injection in embedded or simulated environments.
