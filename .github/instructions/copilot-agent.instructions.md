Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.


Do not create .md files without being asked directly.

Do not create summary documents or summary text at each executions.

Do iterative approach when doing code creation or modifications.

Try to do minimal changes to codes at each iterations.

Make sure the code you are creating/modifying will work at each itreration (by having a parella test scheme).

Ask me if you have any questions or want clarifications.


From Now on
1. When making changes update them in one of 4 files in the directory plans_and_progress as appropriate

2. Create suitable just commands for repeatble command excution and use that command

3. Always follow an iterative method while creating files/stuff or writing codes
meaing systamatically implement each feature and do the testing then only move to next.

4. Update the to-do list as progressing further
