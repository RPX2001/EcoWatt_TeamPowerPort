# 🚀 Security Layer - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Status: READY TO TEST

The security layer is **fully implemented and compiled successfully**. Follow these steps to test it immediately.

---

## Step 1: Upload Firmware (2 minutes)

```bash
cd "d:\Documents\UoM\Semester 7\Embedded\Firmware\PIO\ECOWATT"
pio run --target upload
pio device monitor
```

### ✅ Expected Serial Output:
```
Starting ECOWATT
Initializing Security Layer...
Security Layer: Initialized with nonce = 10000
...
Security Layer: Payload secured with nonce 10001
Security Layer: Payload secured successfully
Secured Payload Size: 2843 bytes
UPLOADING COMPRESSED DATA TO FLASK SERVER
Upload successful to Flask server!
```

---

## Step 2: Start Flask Server (1 minute)

```bash
cd "d:\Documents\UoM\Semester 7\Embedded\Firmware\flask"
python flask_server_hivemq.py
```

### ✅ Expected Flask Output:
```
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5001
🔒 Detected secured payload - removing security layer...
[Security] Verifying payload: nonce=10001, encrypted=False
[Security] ✓ Verification successful: nonce=10001
✓ Security verification successful!
Processing payload with X keys
Found X compressed data items
...
```

---

## Step 3: Verify It's Working

### Check ESP32:
- ✅ "Security Layer: Initialized" appears in serial
- ✅ "Payload secured with nonce XXXX" appears before each upload
- ✅ Upload successful messages

### Check Flask:
- ✅ "🔒 Detected secured payload" appears
- ✅ "✓ Verification successful" appears
- ✅ No "HMAC verification failed" errors
- ✅ Data processes and publishes to MQTT normally

---

## Step 4: Test Nonce Persistence

1. Note the current nonce from ESP32 serial (e.g., 10005)
2. Press RESET button on ESP32
3. Watch serial output after reboot
4. ✅ Nonce should continue from last value (10006, 10007...), not reset to 10000

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Firmware compiles | ✅ Done |
| Security layer initializes | 🔄 Test now |
| Nonce increments | 🔄 Test now |
| Flask verifies HMAC | 🔄 Test now |
| Nonce persists across reboot | 🔄 Test now |
| Data decompresses correctly | 🔄 Test now |

---

## ⚠️ If Something Goes Wrong

### "HMAC verification failed"
- Check: PSK keys match in both `security.cpp` and `server_security_layer.py`
- Solution: Keys are already configured correctly, should work

### "Replay attack detected"
- Cause: Flask still tracking old nonce, ESP32 was reset
- Solution: Restart Flask server

### "No secured payload detected"
- Check: ESP32 successfully secured the payload
- Check: Serial should show "Payload secured with nonce XXX"

### Can't upload firmware
- Check: ESP32 connected via USB
- Check: Correct COM port selected
- Try: Press BOOT button while uploading

## 📊 What You Should See

### Secured Payload Structure:
```json
{
  "nonce": 10001,
  "payload": "eyJkZXZpY2VfaWQiOi4uLn0=",
  "mac": "a7b3c4d5e6f789...",
  "encrypted": false
}
```

### Security Flow:
```
ESP32: Compress → Secure (HMAC) → Upload
Flask: Receive → Verify HMAC → Decompress → MQTT
```

---

## 🔧 Optional: Enable Real AES Encryption

Currently using **mock mode** (Base64 only). To enable real AES:

1. Edit `include/application/security.h`:
   ```cpp
   static const bool ENABLE_ENCRYPTION = true;
   ```

2. Rebuild and upload firmware
