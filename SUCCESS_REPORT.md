### 2. **Remote Configuration** - ✅ COMPLETE
- Runtime configuration updates working
- Changes detected and applied dynamically
- No reboot required for configuration changes

**Evidence:**
```
HTTP Response code: 200
Changed: true
uploadFreqChanged: true, newUploadTimer: 19
regsChanged: true, regsCount: 6
Upload timer set to update in next cycle
```

---

### 3. **Command Execution** - ✅ COMPLETE
- Flask command queue working (5 endpoints operational)
- Commands being queued successfully
- Command history tracking working

**Flask Endpoints Tested:**
```
✅ POST /command/queue - Command queued successfully  
✅ GET /command/history - Returns full command history
✅ GET /command/status - Returns individual command status
✅ POST /command/get - ESP32 can retrieve commands
✅ POST /command/report - ESP32 can report results
```

**Test Results:**
```
✅ CMD_1 through CMD_8 queued successfully
✅ All commands tracked with timestamps
✅ Status changes logged (pending → executing → completed)
```

---

### 4. **Security Layer** - ✅ COMPLETE (Flask Side)
- HMAC-SHA256 authentication implemented
- Anti-replay protection working
- Sequence number tracking operational

**Test Results (test_security.py):**
```
✅ 5/5 tests passed (100%)
✅ Valid requests accepted
✅ Wrong HMAC rejected (401 Unauthorized)
✅ Replay attacks detected and blocked
✅ Sequence tracking: ESP32_EcoWatt_Smart at sequence 4
```

**Security Stats:**
- Total Validations: 6
- Valid Requests: 4
- Invalid Requests: 2 (correctly rejected)
- Devices Tracked: 1

---

### 5. **Data Upload & Compression** - ✅ COMPLETE
- Smart compression working (Dictionary method achieving 91.7% savings)
- Batch upload successful
- Lossless data transmission verified

**Evidence:**
```
DICTIONARY method
Original: 60 bytes → Compressed: 5 bytes (91.7% savings)
Upload successful to Flask server!
Successfully processed 2 entries (10 samples) with 100.0% success
```

---

### 6. **Modbus Communication** - ✅ COMPLETE
- Inverter communication working via HTTP relay
- Valid Modbus frames being exchanged
- Sensor data being collected (VAC1, IAC1, IPV1, PAC, IPV2, TEMP)

---

## ⚠️ **One Remaining Task**

### Security Headers (ESP32 → Flask)
**Status:** Not implemented in current running firmware (1.0.5)

**Issue:** 
- Firmware 1.0.5 was built BEFORE security manager was added
- Current code has security (lines 848-861 in main.cpp)
- Need to build new firmware version with security

**Evidence:**
- ESP32 output shows: "UPLOADING COMPRESSED DATA TO FLASK SERVER"
- But missing: "Security: Sequence=X, HMAC=..."
- Flask accepting uploads without security validation

**Solution:**
Build new firmware (1.0.6) with current code that includes:
- Security manager initialization
- HMAC computation in upload function
- Security headers (X-Sequence-Number, X-HMAC-SHA256)

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### Immediate (5 minutes):
1. **Build firmware 1.0.6** with current security-enabled code
   ```bash
   cd PIO/ECOWATT
   pio run
   ```

2. **Prepare firmware** for deployment
   ```bash
   cd ../../flask
   python prepare_firmware.py
   ```

3. **Test complete security flow**
   - Flash 1.0.6 or let OTA update
   - Verify "Security: Sequence=..." appears in logs
   - Confirm Flask validates HMAC

### Testing (30 minutes):
1. **FOTA Failure Scenarios**
   - Test with wrong hash
   - Test with wrong signature
   - Test rollback mechanism
   - Document results

2. **End-to-End Demo Run**
   - All features working together
   - Record screen for demo video

### Documentation (1 hour):
1. **Demo Video** (10 minutes max)
   - Script ready in PHASE4_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md
   - Show all Phase 4 features
   - Demonstrate FOTA with rollback
